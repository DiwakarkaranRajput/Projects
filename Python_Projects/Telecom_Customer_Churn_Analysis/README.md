# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project explores customer churn in a telecom company using Python for data cleaning, visualization, and exploration. The objective is to uncover key insights from the data to better understand customer behavior and retention factors.

## 🔍 Objective

- Explore customer data to understand usage trends and churn patterns.
- Visualize churn distribution and key influencing features.
- Provide actionable insights that could help reduce customer churn.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🗂️ Dataset

- `Telecom_customer_churn.csv`  
  Contains customer demographic data, service subscription details, and churn status.

## 📌 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Load the dataset and inspect its structure
   - Identify missing values and understand data types

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing or inconsistent entries
   - Format data for analysis

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze churn distribution
   - Explore correlations between customer attributes and churn
   - Visualize tenure, charges, and contract types in relation to churn

4. **Insights & Observations**
   - Identify trends and key metrics linked to churn
   - Offer insights that can help in customer retention strategies

## 📈 Results

- Long-term customers and those with longer contract durations tend to churn less.
- Customers with monthly contracts and higher charges show greater churn risk.
- Automatic payment and fiber optic users have higher churn tendencies.
